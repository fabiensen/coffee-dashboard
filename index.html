      <tbody>
        <tr><td>COT positioning</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>Speculators remain net long, and funds increased their exposure last week. The rise suggests continued speculative appetite for higher prices, though positioning is getting crowded.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Weather (Brazil/Colombia/Vietnam)</td><td class="sig bear">Bearish</td><td>Brazil’s main coffee belt saw some rains, improving soil moisture, while Vietnam forecasts suggest favorable conditions for the upcoming harvest. Weather temporarily eases supply fears.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Port & ICE stocks</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>ICE-certified stocks fell again to ~715k bags, their lowest since early 2024. Persistently low stocks reinforce physical tightness and sustain futures prices.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Logistics / shipping</td><td class="sig neu">Neutral</td><td>Freight rates remain stable after recent increases linked to Red Sea tensions. Logistics no longer adding major upside pressure, but risks remain if global shipping disruptions return.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Tariffs & trade policy</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>The 50% U.S. tariff on Brazilian arabica imports remains in place. It continues to lift internal U.S. costs, ensuring a structural premium on ICE futures contracts.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>FX (USD/BRL)</td><td class="sig bear">Bearish</td><td>The Brazilian real weakened slightly to ~5.58/$, incentivizing Brazilian producers to sell. This FX move exerts mild downward pressure on ICE prices.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Global demand</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>European and Asian consumption remains robust, and despite retail inflation, U.S. demand has held up. Coffee has shown inelasticity compared with other commodities.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Retail prices</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>U.S. roasted coffee prices rose ~30% YoY to $8.41/lb average. Despite higher costs, retail demand has not collapsed, showing resilience of end-consumer demand.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Arabica–Robusta spread</td><td class="sig neu">Neutral</td><td>The spread hovers around 110¢/lb. While wide by historical standards, it has stabilized, suggesting no fresh divergence in substitution dynamics this week.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>ICE stock breakdown</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>Stock drawdowns are concentrated in Honduras and Brazil origins. The lack of fresh certified inflows signals supply remains tight, especially of mild arabicas.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Export flows</td><td class="sig bear">Bearish</td><td>Brazilian July exports (Cecafé) increased slightly compared with last year, while Vietnam shipments were stable. Export availability has not contracted significantly in the past month.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Internal consumption (Brazil/Vietnam)</td><td class="sig neu">Neutral</td><td>No fresh update. Internal consumption in Brazil is steady (~22m bags annually), while Vietnam’s remains modest. No immediate shift in local absorption trends.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fertilizers & energy</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>Fertilizer prices remain above 2023 levels and energy costs are high. Elevated input costs keep farmer margins pressured, limiting incentive for over-supply.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Macro policies & commodities backdrop</td><td class="sig bull">Bullish</td><td>Global soft commodity markets remain elevated. Cocoa’s rally and sugar tightness contribute to broad bullish sentiment across softs, with coffee moving in tandem.</td></tr>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Daily view</h3>
      <p>Arabica futures remain near 385¢/lb, supported by falling certified stocks and U.S. tariffs. Technicals show strong bullish momentum, though RSI suggests the market is nearing overbought conditions. FX (weak BRL) provides some offsetting pressure, but fundamentals dominate.</p>
      <span class="pill">Bias: Bullish</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Weekly view</h3>
      <p>This week’s trend was shaped by another drop in ICE stocks and solid retail demand despite high prices. Exports from Brazil and Vietnam eased some tightness, yet the spread Arabica–Robusta stabilized, reinforcing balance. Overall, the weekly bias remains bullish but with early signs of consolidation.</p>
      <span class="pill">Bias: Bullish</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Monthly view</h3>
      <p>Over the past month, Arabica gained nearly 30%. Tariffs, strong demand, and global softs bullishness kept prices elevated. Weather improvements in Brazil could limit further upside, but macro and input costs suggest the structural bullish background persists. Unless supply surprises emerge, elevated prices are likely to hold into September.</p>
      <span class="pill">Bias: Bullish</span>
