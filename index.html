However, extreme long positions can also set up markets for sharp corrections if sentiment shifts.</td>

This creates a supportive undertone for prices in both markets.</td>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="table-container">
    <p><b>Overall Market Pressure:</b> Neutral with a mild bullish tilt.<br><br>
    Brazil’s favorable weather is strongly bearish, but ongoing dryness in Vietnam offsets some of that supply comfort. Demand remains resilient globally, and speculative funds are leaning bullish. Technical indicators suggest Arabica is holding above support while Robusta approaches overbought territory. Macro headwinds from a stronger USD keep a lid on excessive rallies, but the balance of factors still leans slightly to the upside in the near term.</p>
